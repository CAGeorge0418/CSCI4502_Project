## General description of submission contents. 
The python file Collect_and_Clean_Tweets.py has the main scripts for collecting, cleaning, and adding sentiement analysis to the collected tweets. There are Jupyter notebooks that call the python scripts and save the data to csv files. The data and most of the figures are not inlcuded beacuse it would have made this submission to big. However, the figures should be in the notebook for analysis and the data could be recollected witht the scripts and notebooks. This folder also contains the jupyter notebooks with code to anlyze each NFL team's season (that we picked we picked).
## How to run
These notebooks and scripts do need packages that are not pre-included with python or anaconda. These packages are: SNScrape, NLTK, Textblob, Pattern, Vader, Seaborn, tqdm, pandas, and mlxtnd. Most of the notebook will not work until the data is collected, and file paths may need to be altered depending on where the data is stored. If you want the data without collection, please visit the git hub repositiory: https://github.com/CAGeorge0418/CSCI4502_Project.git
